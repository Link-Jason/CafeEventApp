## üéØ Strategic Purpose: Bridging CX and P&L

The challenge in the hospitality industry is sustaining community-building Customer Experience (CX) initiatives when profit margins are tight. This app was developed to give operators a clear financial indicator, ensuring events that foster customer loyalty and community connection are financially viable.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
* **P&L Modeling:** Calculating revenue, fixed, and variable costs to determine net profit.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Translating real-world operational inputs (staffing hours, ingredient costs) into actionable financial data.
* **Financial Literacy:** Applying a founder's P&L accountability to technical solution development.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Deploying a functional MVP quickly to address a pressing business need.
